Product Teardown Dhan
Problem Statement : 
Grow the Mutual Fund Product within a Stockbroking Platform

Dhan is a stock trading & investing platform built for Super Traders and Long Term Investors. In a short span of 2 years, Dhan has built a strong presence in the broking industry with over half a million registered users on exchanges. The core user base of the product is F&O Traders and Equity Traders.

As a result, Dhan is viewed as a trader-centric product instead of segment/persona-agnostic. Your challenge is to think like a Product Manager at Dhan who wants to:

Grow Mutual Fund investor base on Dhan to 1 Mn+ in next 12 months.
To strategically reposition the platform to embrace a large share of long-term investors, focusing on both stocks and mutual funds.
You must work towards both these goals while ensuring that the business retains and acquires core personas (F&O Traders/Equity Traders).
